### Overview
This project contains a Swift Playground with two pages. The first, demonstrating the basics of animation in iOS. The second, a prototype of a custom transition found on the App Store 'Today' tab.

The repo also contains an Xcode project with a working custom transition, mimicking the previously mentioned app store transition.
